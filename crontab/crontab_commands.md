# üïí **Linux Job Scheduling with Cron & Scripts**

Automating tasks is one of Linux‚Äôs biggest strengths. You can:

* write **shell scripts** to bundle multiple commands together,
* use **cron** to run those scripts or single commands on a schedule.

This guide walks through every piece step by step.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Crontab

`crontab` (‚Äúcron table‚Äù) is a per-user file that lists jobs for cron to execute.

### Basic Commands

| Command                     | Purpose                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `crontab -e`                | Edit your crontab (opens editor)     |
| `crontab -l`                | List your scheduled jobs             |
| `crontab -r`                | Remove all jobs for your user        |
| `sudo crontab -u <user> -l` | (root only) View another user‚Äôs jobs |

**Example session:**

```bash
$ crontab -l
no crontab for deepak
$ crontab -e      # add jobs
```

---

### The Crontab Line Format

Each job line:

```
minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week command_to_run
```

Five time fields + one command. The asterisk `*` means ‚Äúevery possible value.‚Äù

| Field        | Allowed Values | Example Value         | Meaning           |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Minute       | 0‚Äì59           | `0`                   | start of the hour |
| Hour         | 0‚Äì23           | `18`                  | 6 PM              |
| Day of Month | 1‚Äì31           | `10`                  | 10th day          |
| Month        | 1‚Äì12           | `12`                  | December          |
| Day of Week  | 0‚Äì6            | `0` or `7` for Sunday | Sunday            |

---

### Scheduling Examples

| Schedule                          | Crontab Line                         | What Happens             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Every minute                      | `* * * * * /home/deepak/logtime.sh`  | Script runs every minute |
| Daily at 6 PM                     | `0 18 * * * /home/deepak/sysinfo.sh` | At 18:00                 |
| On the 10th of each month at 6 PM | `0 18 10 * * /home/deepak/backup.sh` | At 6 PM, day 10          |
| Every Sunday                      | `* * * * 0 /home/deepak/weekly.sh`   | All day Sunday           |

> **Tip:** Always use full paths (`/home/deepak/script.sh`) and full paths to commands inside scripts (`/usr/bin/find`, `/usr/bin/tar`) when running from cron. Cron doesn‚Äôt load your normal shell‚Äôs PATH.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ User Permissions & Root Control in Cron

Cron is powerful, but not every user should always have permission to schedule jobs. Linux has a built-in system to **control who can and cannot use cron**.

---

### üîπ Default Behavior

1. **Every user can have their own crontab file.**

   * Example: If user **ajay** runs `crontab -e`, they get their own cron table.
   * Cron will execute their jobs under **ajay‚Äôs account**, not as root.

2. **The root user has full control.**

   * Root can **view, edit, or delete** the cron jobs of any user.

For example, if root wants to **see what cron jobs ajay has scheduled**, they can run:

```bash
sudo crontab -u ajay -l
```

üëâ This will list all jobs in ajay‚Äôs crontab.
üëâ Similarly, root can **edit** ajay‚Äôs crontab with:

```bash
sudo crontab -u ajay -e
```

---

### üîπ Restricting Users

Sometimes you don‚Äôt want certain users to be able to schedule cron jobs (for security or resource reasons).

There are **two special files** that control access:

1. `/etc/cron.allow` ‚Üí If this file exists, **only users listed inside it** can use cron.
2. `/etc/cron.deny` ‚Üí Users listed inside this file are **blocked from using cron**.

üìå Most Linux systems use `/etc/cron.deny` by default.

---

### üîπ Example: Denying a User

Suppose we don‚Äôt want user **neeta** to use cron. As root, run:

```bash
echo "neeta" | sudo tee -a /etc/cron.deny
```
üëâ Let‚Äôs break this down:

* `echo "neeta"` ‚Üí Prints the word **neeta**.
* `|` (pipe) ‚Üí Sends that output into the next command.
* `sudo tee -a /etc/cron.deny` ‚Üí

  * `tee` writes input into a file.
  * `-a` means **append** (don‚Äôt overwrite existing content).
  * `/etc/cron.deny` is the file where we‚Äôre adding her name.

‚úÖ Effect: The word **neeta** gets added as a new line inside `/etc/cron.deny`.



Now, if neeta tries to run `crontab -e`, she will see:

```text
You (neeta) are not allowed to use this program (crontab)
```

üëâ This means she can no longer create or edit cron jobs.

---

### üîπ Example: Allowing Only Specific Users

If you want **only a few users** to be able to use cron, create `/etc/cron.allow` and list their names inside:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/cron.allow
```

Add:

```
ajay
deepak
```

üëâ Now, **only ajay and deepak** can use cron.
üëâ All other users will be blocked automatically.


---

üí° **Real-World Example:**
Imagine a system with many users, but only the admins should schedule jobs.

* You‚Äôd create `/etc/cron.allow` and list only the admins.
* This prevents mistakes like a random user scheduling a heavy script every minute, which could overload the server.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Writing Shell Scripts for Cron Jobs

When cron jobs become longer or involve multiple commands, it‚Äôs better to put them inside a **shell script** instead of writing everything directly in crontab. This makes the job easier to manage, debug, and reuse.

---

### Step 1 ‚Äì Create a Script

Open a new file for your script:

```bash
vi /home/deepak/job1.sh
```

Add the following content inside:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Backup started at $(date)" >> /home/deepak/backup.log
```

üîé **Explanation:**

* `#!/bin/bash` ‚Üí Tells Linux to run the file using the Bash shell.
* `echo "Backup started at $(date)"` ‚Üí Prints a message with the current date & time.
* `>> /home/deepak/backup.log` ‚Üí Appends the message to a log file instead of showing it on screen.

---

### Step 2 ‚Äì Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x /home/deepak/job1.sh
```

This allows Linux to **run the file as a program**. Without this, cron won‚Äôt execute it.

---

### Step 3 ‚Äì Add It to Crontab

Edit your crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the line:

```
* * * * * /home/deepak/job1.sh
```

üîé **Explanation:**

* `* * * * *` ‚Üí Run every minute.
* `/home/deepak/job1.sh` ‚Üí Full path to your script.

---

### Step 4 ‚Äì Check If It‚Äôs Running

Look inside the log file:

```bash
tail -f /home/deepak/backup.log
```

You‚Äôll see entries like:

```
Backup started at Tue Sep 17 10:00:01 IST 2025
Backup started at Tue Sep 17 10:01:01 IST 2025
```

‚úÖ Congratulations! You‚Äôve automated your first task with cron + scripts.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Script Examples

Now let‚Äôs explore some **real-world scripts** that can be scheduled using cron.

---

### Example 1 ‚Äì Log Current Date & Time Every Minute

Create script `/home/deepak/logtime.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Current time: $(date)" >> /home/deepak/time.log
```

Add to crontab:

```
* * * * * /home/deepak/logtime.sh
```

Check log file:

```bash
tail -f /home/deepak/time.log
```

Output:

```
Current time: Tue Sep 17 10:02:01 IST 2025
Current time: Tue Sep 17 10:03:01 IST 2025
```

---

### Example 2 ‚Äì Collect System Information Daily at 6 PM

Create script `/home/deepak/sysinfo.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
{
echo "----- $(date) -----"
/bin/hostname
/bin/uname -r
/usr/bin/free -m
/usr/bin/last -n 5
echo "-------------------"
} >> /home/deepak/result.txt
```

Schedule in crontab:

```
0 18 * * * /home/deepak/sysinfo.sh
```

At **6 PM every day**, it will save:

```
----- Tue Sep 17 18:00:00 IST 2025 -----
myserver
6.6.32-xyz
              total        used        free
Mem:           1994         350        1644
deepak pts/0    2025-09-17 17:50
...
-------------------
```

---

### Example 3 ‚Äì Complex Admin Tasks (Once a Year)

Script `/home/deepak/admin_tasks.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Copy all files owned by 'sara' to /backup
/usr/bin/find / -user sara -exec /bin/cp {} /backup/ \;

# Delete all files owned by 'harry'
/usr/bin/find / -user harry -exec /bin/rm {} \;

# Archive and compress /etc directory
/usr/bin/tar -cvJf /backup/etc.tar.xz /etc
```

Schedule on **10 December at 6:30 PM**:

```
30 18 10 12 * /home/deepak/admin_tasks.sh
```

At that time:

* Files owned by `sara` are copied.
* Files owned by `harry` are removed.
* `/etc` is archived into `/backup/etc.tar.xz`.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging Cron Jobs

Cron runs silently, so you won‚Äôt see errors on your screen.

### Check System Log

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/cron
```

Example output:

```
Sep 17 10:00:01 myserver CRON[2489]: (deepak) CMD (/home/deepak/job1.sh)
Sep 17 10:01:01 myserver CRON[2512]: (deepak) CMD (/home/deepak/job1.sh)
```

If a command is missing, you‚Äôll see `command not found` here.

---

### Capture Errors in a Log File

Redirect both output and errors to a log:

```
* * * * * /home/deepak/job1.sh >> /home/deepak/job1.log 2>&1
```

* `>>` ‚Üí Append normal output.
* `2>&1` ‚Üí Capture errors (stderr) too.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Recap Table

| Task                            | Command                      | What It Does                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Edit your cron                  | `crontab -e`                 | Opens editor to add jobs    |
| List jobs                       | `crontab -l`                 | Shows your current schedule |
| Remove all jobs                 | `crontab -r`                 | Deletes all your cron jobs  |
| View another user‚Äôs jobs (root) | `sudo crontab -u ajay -l`    | Show `ajay`‚Äôs cron tasks    |
| Monitor log                     | `sudo tail -f /var/log/cron` | Watch cron jobs as they run |

---

üëâ This way, you can use **scripts + cron** to automate almost anything: logging, backups, monitoring, or system administration.
